# CS320 Test Automation

I can ensure that my code, program and software is functional and secure by developing a test plan that takes into consideration customer requirements, industry compliance standards (if any), and quality standards adhered to by the company and development team. 

User needs are incorporated into a functional test plan to ensure that features act in a way that is expected by the user. 

I approach software design by including testing in the software design lifecycle, ensuring that unit tests are written to provide code-coverage, ensure requirements are met, and the code functions for the anticipated use case. As new cases are uncovered more tests are added over time to provide for regression testing.
